# SYSTEM PROGRAMMING 2023-2024 FALL TERM PROJECT
This project is an archive program that works like tar,rar or zip.

1st version of the program can read files but cannot correctly. For example it writes content of t2 to t1, t3 to t2, t4 to t3,etc.

2nd version , we solved this issue by replacing '\n' character. But 2nd version is not completely true because user cannot decide putput file name. It's always a.sau.
